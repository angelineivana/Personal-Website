    "description": "Our task in this project was to identify MSMEs that required a website for their business. It took us approximately four months to complete the project, during which I contributed to the rebranding and design of Powtaytow's Wix website. Additionally, I created social media content for the company's Instagram account, @powtaytow.id, by copywriting. The website features a store section, as well as information on the products' recipes, fun facts, contact information, and a cart. We collaborated on the website's design and gained valuable knowledge about social media marketing strategies to promote the Powtaytow brand and its products by generating high-quality content."
