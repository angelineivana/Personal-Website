    "description": "We developed a POS system application utilizing C# for our project, featuring a total of 8 forms, namely Login, Forgot Password, Change Password, Menu, Cashier, Catalog, Invoice, and History. I assigned different tasks to my team members, and I personally handled the Login, Menu, and Cashier forms. Additionally, I designed the application interface and assisted other team members with creating their assigned forms."
