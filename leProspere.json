    "description": "LE PROSPEREâ€™s Inventory Management Website and Catalog Website are the final projects of the System Analysis & Design subject at Universitas Ciputra Surabaya. This project took around 16 weeks. Although we had our own roles, we worked together in all the processes. To do this project, we generally started by searching for UMKM (Usaha Mikro Kecil dan Menengah) whose system needed to be developed, arranging our planning for both of the websites, producing basic data designs, making prototypes, building the websites, and doing user testing."
